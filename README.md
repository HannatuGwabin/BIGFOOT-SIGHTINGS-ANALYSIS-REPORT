# BIGFOOT-SIGHTINGS-ANALYSIS-REPORT
# POMEROL PARTNERS #DATADNA CHALLENGE

During this challenge, I utilized Microsoft Power BI to strengthen my data analytics and visualization abilities, allowing me to gain a more comprehensive comprehension of bigfoot sightings and to detect any potential factors that might be influencing their frequency.
I would like to extend my appreciation to the sponsors of this challenge, namely Pomerol Partners, Qlik, novyPro, DATAcated, Packt, and Astrato Analytics. I am grateful for the incredible opportunity you have given me to enhance my skills.
